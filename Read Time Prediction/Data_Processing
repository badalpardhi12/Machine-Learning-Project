He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little was known, except that he was a polished man of the world. People said that he resembled Byron—at least that his head was Byronic; but he was a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without growing old.\\n\\nCertainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was a Londoner. He was never seen on \\'Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the counting-rooms of the \"City\"; no ships ever came into London docks of which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been entered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln\\'s Inn, or Gray\\'s Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen\\'s Bench, or the Ecclesiastical Courts. He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer. His name was strange to the scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London Institution, the Artisan\\'s Association, or the Institution of Arts and Sciences. He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies which swarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the Entomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious insects.\\n\\nPhileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all.\\n\\nThe way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple enough.\\n\\nHe was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open credit. His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current, which was always flush.\\n\\nWas Phileas Fogg rich? Undoubtedly. But those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information. He was not lavish, nor, on the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously. He was, in short, the least communicative of men. He talked very little, and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner. His daily habits were quite open to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before, that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled.\\n\\nHad he travelled? It was likely, for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it. He often corrected, with a few clear words, the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard-of travellers, pointing out the true probabilities, and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight, so often did events justify his predictions. He must have travelled everywhere, at least in the spirit.\\n\\nIt was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from London for many years. Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else. His sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist. He often won at this game, which, as a silent one, harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went into his purse, being reserved as a fund for his charities. Mr. Fogg played, not to win, but for the sake of playing. The game was in his eyes a contest, a struggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless, unwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes.\\n\\nPhileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which may happen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends, which is certainly more unusual. He lived alone in his house in Saville Row, whither none penetrated. A single domestic sufficed to serve him. He breakfasted and dined at the club, at hours mathematically fixed, in the same room, at the same table, never taking his meals with other members, much less bringing a guest with him; and went home at exactly midnight, only to retire at once to bed. He never used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members. He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping or making his toilet. When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring, or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns, and illumined by blue painted windows. When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club—its kitchens and pantries, its buttery and dairy—aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters, in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin soles, who proffered the viands in special porcelain, and on the finest linen; club decanters, of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port, and his cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled with ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes.\\n\\nIf to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that there is something good in eccentricity.\\n\\nThe mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly comfortable. The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but little from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be almost superhumanly prompt and regular. On this very 2nd of October he had dismissed James Forster, because that luckless youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor, who was due at the house between eleven and half-past.\\n\\nPhileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his knees, his body straight, his head erect; he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds, the days, the months, and the years. At exactly half-past eleven Mr. Fogg would, according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair to the Reform.\\n\\nA rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where Phileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant, appeared.\\n\\n\"The new servant,\" said he.\\n\\nA young man of thirty advanced and bowed.\\n\\n\"You are a Frenchman, I believe,\" asked Phileas Fogg, \"and your name is John?\"\\n\\n\"Jean, if monsieur pleases,\" replied the newcomer, \"Jean Passepartout, a surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for going out of one business into another. I believe I\\'m honest, monsieur, but, to be outspoken, I\\'ve had several trades. I\\'ve been an itinerant singer, a circus-rider, when I used to vault like Leotard, and dance on a rope like Blondin. Then I got to be a professor of gymnastics, so as to make better use of my talents; and then I was a sergeant fireman at Paris, and assisted at many a big fire. But I quitted France five years ago, and, wishing to taste the sweets of domestic life, took service as a valet here in England. Finding myself out of place, and hearing that Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact and settled gentleman in the United Kingdom, I have come to monsieur in the hope of living with him a tranquil life, and forgetting even the name of Passepartout.\"\\n\\n\"Passepartout suits me,\" responded Mr. Fogg. \"You are well recommended to me; I hear a good report of you. You know my conditions?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\\n\\n\"Good! What time is it?\"\\n\\n\"Twenty-two minutes after eleven,\" returned Passepartout, drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket.\\n\\n\"You are too slow,\" said Mr. Fogg.\\n\\n\"Pardon me, monsieur, it is impossible—\"\\n\\n\"You are four minutes too slow. No matter; it\\'s enough to mention the error. Now from this moment, twenty-nine minutes after eleven, a.m., this Wednesday, 2nd October, you are in my service.\"\\n\\nPhileas Fogg got up, took his hat in his left hand, put it on his head with an automatic motion, and went off without a word.\\n\\nPassepartout heard the street door shut once; it was his new master going out. He heard it shut again; it was his predecessor, James Forster, departing in his turn. Passepartout remained alone in the house in Saville Row.'\n","  nan]\n"," [2 1873 'France' ... 375\n","  '\"Faith,\" muttered Passepartout, somewhat flurried, \"I\\'ve seen people at Madame Tussaud\\'s as lively as my new master!\"\\n\\nMadame Tussaud\\'s \"people,\" let it be said, are of wax, and are much visited in London; speech is all that is wanting to make them human.\\n\\nDuring his brief interview with Mr. Fogg, Passepartout had been carefully observing him. He appeared to be a man about forty years of age, with fine, handsome features, and a tall, well-shaped figure; his hair and whiskers were light, his forehead compact and unwrinkled, his face rather pale, his teeth magnificent. His countenance possessed in the highest degree what physiognomists call \"repose in action,\" a quality of those who act rather than talk. Calm and phlegmatic, with a clear eye, Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure which Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas. Seen in the various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of being perfectly well-balanced, as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer. Phileas Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified, and this was betrayed even in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men, as well as in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions.\\n\\nHe was so exact that he was never in a hurry, was always ready, and was economical alike of his steps and his motions. He never took one step too many, and always went to his destination by the shortest cut; he made no superfluous gestures, and was never seen to be moved or agitated. He was the most deliberate person in the world, yet always reached his destination at the exact moment.\\n\\nHe lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation; and as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction, and that friction retards, he never rubbed against anybody.\\n\\nAs for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian of Paris. Since he had abandoned his own country for England, taking service as a valet, he had in vain searched for a master after his own heart. Passepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Moliere with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow, with a pleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, soft-mannered and serviceable, with a good round head, such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend. His eyes were blue, his complexion rubicund, his figure almost portly and well-built, his body muscular, and his physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days. His brown hair was somewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging Minerva\\'s tresses, Passepartout was familiar with but one of dressing his own: three strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet.\\n\\nIt would be rash to predict how Passepartout\\'s lively nature would agree with Mr. Fogg. It was impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required; experience alone could solve the question. Passepartout had been a sort of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned for repose; but so far he had failed to find it, though he had already served in ten English houses. But he could not take root in any of these; with chagrin, he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular, constantly running about the country, or on the look-out for adventure. His last master, young Lord Longferry, Member of Parliament, after passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home in the morning on policemen\\'s shoulders. Passepartout, desirous of respecting the gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remonstrance on such conduct; which, being ill-received, he took his leave. Hearing that Mr. Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was one of unbroken regularity, that he neither travelled nor stayed from home overnight, he felt sure that this would be the place he was after. He presented himself, and was accepted, as has been seen.\\n\\nAt half-past eleven, then, Passepartout found himself alone in the house in Saville Row. He begun its inspection without delay, scouring it from cellar to garret. So clean, well-arranged, solemn a mansion pleased him; it seemed to him like a snail\\'s shell, lighted and warmed by gas, which sufficed for both these purposes. When Passepartout reached the second story he recognised at once the room which he was to inhabit, and he was well satisfied with it. Electric bells and speaking-tubes afforded communication with the lower stories; while on the mantel stood an electric clock, precisely like that in Mr. Fogg\\'s bedchamber, both beating the same second at the same instant. \"That\\'s good, that\\'ll do,\" said Passepartout to himself.\\n\\nHe suddenly observed, hung over the clock, a card which, upon inspection, proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house. It comprised all that was required of the servant, from eight in the morning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, till half-past eleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club—all the details of service, the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight, the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine, and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten. Everything was regulated and foreseen that was to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till midnight, the hour at which the methodical gentleman retired.\\n\\nMr. Fogg\\'s wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste. Each pair of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing; and the same system was applied to the master\\'s shoes. In short, the house in Saville Row, which must have been a very temple of disorder and unrest under the illustrious but dissipated Sheridan, was cosiness, comfort, and method idealised. There was no study, nor were there books, which would have been quite useless to Mr. Fogg; for at the Reform two libraries, one of general literature and the other of law and politics, were at his service. A moderate-sized safe stood in his bedroom, constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but Passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere; everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits.\\n\\nHaving scrutinised the house from top to bottom, he rubbed his hands, a broad smile overspread his features, and he said joyfully, \"This is just what I wanted! Ah, we shall get on together, Mr. Fogg and I! What a domestic and regular gentleman! A real machine; well, I don\\'t mind serving a machine.\"'\n","  nan]\n"," [3 1873 'France' ... 648\n","  'Phileas Fogg, having shut the door of his house at half–past eleven, and having put his right foot before his left five hundred and seventy–five times, and his left foot before his right five hundred and seventy–six times, reached the Reform Club, an imposing edifice in Pall Mall, which could not have cost less than three millions. He repaired at once to the dining–room, the nine windows of which open upon a tasteful garden, where the trees were already gilded with an autumn colouring; and took his place at the habitual table, the cover of which had already been laid for him. His breakfast consisted of a side–dish, a broiled fish with Reading sauce, a scarlet slice of roast beef garnished with mushrooms, a rhubarb and gooseberry tart, and a morsel of Cheshire cheese, the whole being washed down with several cups of tea, for which the Reform is famous. He rose at thirteen minutes to one, and directed his steps towards the large hall, a sumptuous apartment adorned with lavishly–framed paintings. A flunkey handed him an uncut Times, which he proceeded to cut with a skill which betrayed familiarity with this delicate operation. The perusal of this paper absorbed Phileas Fogg until a quarter before four, whilst the Standard, his next task, occupied him till the dinner hour. Dinner passed as breakfast had done, and Mr. Fogg re–appeared in the reading–room and sat down to the Pall Mall at twenty minutes before six. Half an hour later several members of the Reform came in and drew up to the fireplace, where a coal fire was steadily burning. They were Mr. Fogg\\'s usual partners at whist: Andrew Stuart, an engineer; John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, bankers; Thomas Flanagan, a brewer; and Gauthier Ralph, one of the Directors of the Bank of England—all rich and highly respectable personages, even in a club which comprises the princes of English trade and finance.\\n\\n\"Well, Ralph,\" said Thomas Flanagan, \"what about that robbery?\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" replied Stuart, \"the Bank will lose the money.\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary,\" broke in Ralph, \"I hope we may put our hands on the robber. Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of America and the Continent, and he\\'ll be a clever fellow if he slips through their fingers.\"\\n\\n\"But have you got the robber\\'s description?\" asked Stuart.\\n\\n\"In the first place, he is no robber at all,\" returned Ralph, positively.\\n\\n\"What! a fellow who makes off with fifty–five thousand pounds, no robber?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps he\\'s a manufacturer, then.\"\\n\\n\"The Daily Telegraph says that he is a gentleman.\"\\n\\nIt was Phileas Fogg, whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers, who made this remark. He bowed to his friends, and entered into the conversation. The affair which formed its subject, and which was town talk, had occurred three days before at the Bank of England. A package of banknotes, to the value of fifty–five thousand pounds, had been taken from the principal cashier\\'s table, that functionary being at the moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and sixpence. Of course, he could not have his eyes everywhere. Let it be observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the honesty of the public. There are neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures; gold, silver, banknotes are freely exposed, at the mercy of the first comer. A keen observer of English customs relates that, being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day, he had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds. He took it up, scrutinised it, passed it to his neighbour, he to the next man, and so on until the ingot, going from hand to hand, was transferred to the end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its place for half an hour. Meanwhile, the cashier had not so much as raised his head. But in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly. The package of notes not being found when five o\\'clock sounded from the ponderous clock in the \"drawing office,\" the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss. As soon as the robbery was discovered, picked detectives hastened off to Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez, Brindisi, New York, and other ports, inspired by the proffered reward of two thousand pounds, and five per cent. on the sum that might be recovered. Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those who arrived at or left London by rail, and a judicial examination was at once entered upon.\\n\\nThere were real grounds for supposing, as the Daily Telegraph said, that the thief did not belong to a professional band. On the day of the robbery a well–dressed gentleman of polished manners, and with a well–to–do air, had been observed going to and fro in the paying room where the crime was committed. A description of him was easily procured and sent to the detectives; and some hopeful spirits, of whom Ralph was one, did not despair of his apprehension. The papers and clubs were full of the affair, and everywhere people were discussing the probabilities of a successful pursuit; and the Reform Club was especially agitated, several of its members being Bank officials.\\n\\nRalph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to be in vain, for he thought that the prize offered would greatly stimulate their zeal and activity. But Stuart was far from sharing this confidence; and, as they placed themselves at the whist–table, they continued to argue the matter. Stuart and Flanagan played together, while Phileas Fogg had Fallentin for his partner. As the game proceeded the conversation ceased, excepting between the rubbers, when it revived again.\\n\\n\"I maintain,\" said Stuart, \"that the chances are in favour of the thief, who must be a shrewd fellow.\"\\n\\n\"Well, but where can he fly to?\" asked Ralph. \"No country is safe for him.\"\\n\\n\"Pshaw!\"\\n\\n\"Where could he go, then?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know that. The world is big enough.\"\\n\\n\"It was once,\" said Phileas Fogg, in a low tone. \"Cut, sir,\" he added, handing the cards to Thomas Flanagan.\\n\\nThe discussion fell during the rubber, after which Stuart took up its thread.\\n\\n\"What do you mean by `once\\'? Has the world grown smaller?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" returned Ralph. \"I agree with Mr. Fogg. The world has grown smaller, since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly than a hundred years ago. And that is why the search for this thief will be more likely to succeed.\"\\n\\n\"And also why the thief can get away more easily.\"\\n\\n\"Be so good as to play, Mr. Stuart,\" said Phileas Fogg.\\n\\nBut the incredulous Stuart was not convinced, and when the hand was finished, said eagerly: \"You have a strange way, Ralph, of proving that the world has grown smaller. So, because you can go round it in three months—\"\\n\\n\"In eighty days,\" interrupted Phileas Fogg.\\n\\n\"That is true, gentlemen,\" added John Sullivan. \"Only eighty days, now that the section between Rothal and Allahabad, on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, has been opened. Here is the estimate made by the Daily Telegraph:\\n\\n      From London to Suez via Mont Cenis and\\n      Brindisi, by rail and steamboats ...................  7 days\\n      From Suez to Bombay, by steamer .................... 13  \"\\n      From Bombay to Calcutta, by rail ...................  3  \"\\n      From Calcutta to Hong Kong, by steamer ............. 13  \"\\n      From Hong Kong to Yokohama (Japan), by steamer .....  6  \"\\n      From Yokohama to San Francisco, by steamer ......... 22  \"\\n      From San Francisco to New York, by rail ............. 7  \"\\n      From New York to London, by steamer and rail ........ 9  \"\\n                                                           –––––––\\n        Total ............................................ 80 days.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, in eighty days!\" exclaimed Stuart, who in his excitement made a false deal. \"But that doesn\\'t take into account bad weather, contrary winds, shipwrecks, railway accidents, and so on.\"\\n\\n\"All included,\" returned Phileas Fogg, continuing to play despite the discussion.\\n\\n\"But suppose the Hindoos or Indians pull up the rails,\" replied Stuart; \"suppose they stop the trains, pillage the luggage–vans, and scalp the passengers!\"\\n\\n\"All included,\" calmly retorted Fogg; adding, as he threw down the cards, \"Two trumps.\"\\n\\nStuart, whose turn it was to deal, gathered them up, and went on: \"You are right, theoretically, Mr. Fogg, but practically—\"\\n\\n\"Practically also, Mr. Stuart.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d like to see you do it in eighty days.\"\\n\\n\"It depends on you. Shall we go?\"\\n\\n\"Heaven preserve me! But I would wager four thousand pounds that such a journey, made under these conditions, is impossible.\"\\n\\n\"Quite possible, on the contrary,\" returned Mr. Fogg.\\n\\n\"Well, make it, then!\"\\n\\n\"The journey round the world in eighty days?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I should like nothing better.\"\\n\\n\"When?\"\\n\\n\"At once. Only I warn you that I shall do it at your expense.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s absurd!\" cried Stuart, who was beginning to be annoyed at the persistency of his friend. \"Come, let\\'s go on with the game.\"\\n\\n\"Deal over again, then,\" said Phileas Fogg. \"There\\'s a false deal.\"\\n\\nStuart took up the pack with a feverish hand; then suddenly put them down again.\\n\\n\"Well, Mr. Fogg,\" said he, \"it shall be so: I will wager the four thousand on it.\"\\n\\n\"Calm yourself, my dear Stuart,\" said Fallentin. \"It\\'s only a joke.\"\\n\\n\"When I say I\\'ll wager,\" returned Stuart, \"I mean it.\" \"All right,\" said Mr. Fogg; and, turning to the others, he continued: \"I have a deposit of twenty thousand at Baring\\'s which I will willingly risk upon it.\"\\n\\n\"Twenty thousand pounds!\" cried Sullivan. \"Twenty thousand pounds, which you would lose by a single accidental delay!\"\\n\\n\"The unforeseen does not exist,\" quietly replied Phileas Fogg.\\n\\n\"But, Mr. Fogg, eighty days are only the estimate of the least possible time in which the journey can be made.\"\\n\\n\"A well–used minimum suffices for everything.\"\\n\\n\"But, in order not to exceed it, you must jump mathematically from the trains upon the steamers, and from the steamers upon the trains again.\"\\n\\n\"I will jump—mathematically.\"\\n\\n\"You are joking.\"\\n\\n\"A true Englishman doesn\\'t joke when he is talking about so serious a thing as a wager,\" replied Phileas Fogg, solemnly. \"I will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours, or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes. Do you accept?\"\\n\\n\"We accept,\" replied Messrs. Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan, Flanagan, and Ralph, after consulting each other.\\n\\n\"Good,\" said Mr. Fogg. \"The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before nine. I will take it.\"\\n\\n\"This very evening?\" asked Stuart.\\n\\n\"This very evening,\" returned Phileas Fogg. He took out and consulted a pocket almanac, and added, \"As today is Wednesday, the 2nd of October, I shall be due in London in this very room of the Reform Club, on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine p.m.; or else the twenty thousand pounds, now deposited in my name at Baring\\'s, will belong to you, in fact and in right, gentlemen. Here is a cheque for the amount.\"\\n\\nA memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties, during which Phileas Fogg preserved a stoical composure.

Introductory.\\n\\n        A Proposition of Relation, of the kind to be here discussed has, for \\nits Terms, two Specieses of the same Genus, such that each of the two \\nNames conveys the idea of some Attribute not conveyed by the other.\\n\\n        [Thus, the Proposition “Some merchants are misers” is of the right \\nkind, since “merchants” and “misers” are Specieses of the same Genus \\n“men”; and since the Name “merchants” conveys the idea of the Attribute \\n“mercantile”, and the name “misers” the idea of the Attribute “miserly”.\\n each of which ideas is not conveyed by the other Name. But the \\nProposition “Some dogs are setters” is not of the right kind, since, \\nalthough it is true that “dogs” and “setters” are Specieses of the same \\nGenus “animals”, it is not true that the Name “dogs” conveys the idea of\\n any Attribute not conveyed by the Name “setters”. Such Pro- positions \\nwill be discussed in Part II.]\\n\\n        The Genus, of which the two Terms are Species, is called the ‘Universe of Discourse,’ or (more briefly) the Univ.’\\n\\n        The Sign of Quantity is “Some” or “No” or “All”.\\n\\n        [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us how many Members of \\nits Subject are also Members of its Predicate, it does not tell us the \\nexact number: in fact, it only deals with three numbers, which are, in \\nascending order, “0”, “1 or more”, “the total number of Members of the \\nSubject”.]\\n\\n        It is called “a Proposition of Relation” because its effect is to assert that a certain relationship exists between its Terms.\\n\\n        Section 2. Reduction of a Proposition of Relation to Normal form.\\n\\n        The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:–\\n\\n        (1) Ascertain what is the Subject (i.e., ascertain what Class we are talking about);\\n\\n        (2) If the verb, governed by the Subject, is not the verb “are” (or \\n“is”), substitute for it a phrase beginning with “are” (or “is”);\\n\\n        (3) Ascertain what is the Predicate (i.e., ascertain what Class it is, \\nwhich is asserted to contain some, or none, or all, of the Members of \\nthe Subject);\\n\\n        (4) If the Name of each Term is completely expressed (i.e. if it \\ncontains a Substantive), there is no need to determine the ‘Univ.’; but,\\n if either Name is incompletely expressed, and contains Attributes only,\\n it is then necessary to determine a ‘Univ.’, in order to insert its \\nName as the Substantive\\n\\n        (5) Ascertain the Sign of Quantity;\\n\\n        (6) Arrange in the following order:– Sign of Quantity, Subject, Copula, Predicate.\\n\\n        [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules.\\n\\n        (1) “Some apples are not ripe.”\\n\\n        (1) The Subject is “apples.”\\n\\n        (2) The Verb is “are.”\\n\\n        (3) The Predicate is “not-ripe * * .” (As no Sub- stantive is \\nexpressed, and we have not yet settled what the Univ. is to be, we are \\nforced to leave a blank.)\\n\\n        (4) Let Univ. be “fruit.”\\n\\n        (5) The Sign of Quantity is “some.”\\n\\n        (6) The Proposition now becomes “Some | apples | are | not-ripe fruit.”\\n\\n        (2) “None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent.”\\n\\n        (1) The Subject is “my speculations.”\\n\\n        (2) The Verb is “have brought,” for which we substitute the phrase “are * * * that have brought”.\\n\\n        (3) The Predicate is ” * * * that have brought &c.”\\n\\n        (4) Let Univ. be “transactions.”\\n\\n        (5) The Sign of Quantity is “none of.”\\n\\n        (6) The Proposition now becomes “None of | my speculations | are | transactions that have brought me as much as 5 per cent.”\\n\\n        (3) “None but the brave deserve the fair.” To begin with, we note that \\nthe phrase ‘none buit the brave” is equivalent to “no not-brave.”\\n\\n        (1) The Subject has for its Attribute “not-brave.” But no Substantive \\nis supplied. So we express the Subject as “not-brave * * * .”\\n\\n        (2) The Verb is “deserve,” for which we substitute the phrase “are deserving of”.\\n\\n        (3) The Predicate is ” * * * deserving of the fair.”\\n\\n        (4) Let Univ. be “persons.”\\n\\n        (5) The Sign of Quantity is “no.”\\n\\n        (6) The Proposition now becomes “No | not-brave persons | are | persons deserving of the fair.”\\n\\n        (4) “A lame puppy would not say “thank you” if you offered to lend it a skipping-rope.”\\n\\n        (1) The Subject is evidently “lame puppies,” and all the rest of the sentence must somehow be packed into the Predicate.\\n\\n        (2) The Verb is “would not say,” &c., for which we may substitute the phrase “are not grateful for.”\\n\\n        (3) The Predicate may be expressed as ” * * * not grateful for the loan of a skipping-rope.”\\n\\n        (4) Let Univ. be “puppies.”\\n\\n        (5) The Sign of Quantity is “all.”\\n\\n        (6) The Proposition now becomes “All | lame puppies | are | puppies not grateful for the loan of a skipping-rope.”\\n\\n        (5) “No one take in the Times, unless he is well-educated.”\\n\\n        (1) The Subject is evidently persons who are not well-\\n\\n        educated (“no one” evidently means “no person”). (2) The Verb is “take \\nin,” for which we may substitute the phrase “are persons taking in.”\\n\\n        (3) The Predicate is “persons taking in the Times.”\\n\\n        (4) Let Univ. be “persons.”\\n\\n        (5) The Sign of Quantity is “no.”\\n\\n        (6) The Proposition now becomes “No | persons who are not well-educated | are | person taking in the Times.”\\n\\n        (6) “My carriage will meet you at the station.”\\n\\n        (1) The Subject is “my carriage.” This, being an ‘In- dividual,’ is \\nequivalent to the Class “my carriages.” (Note that this Class contains \\nonly one Member.)\\n\\n        (2) The Verb is “will meet”, for which we may substitute the phrase “are * * * that will meet.”\\n\\n        (3) The Predicate is “ * * that will meet you at the station.”\\n\\n        (4) Let Univ. be “things.”\\n\\n        (5) The Sign of Quantity is “all.”\\n\\n        (6) The Proposition now becomes “All | my carriages | are | things that will meet you at the station.”\\n\\n        (7) “Happy is the man who does not know what ‘toothache’ means!”\\n\\n        (1) The Subject is evidently “the man &c.” (Note that in this \\nsentence, the Predicate comes first.) At first sight, the Subject seems \\nto be an ‘Individual’; but on further consideration, we see that the \\narticle “the” does not imply that there is only one such man. Hence the \\nphrase “the man who” is equivalent to ” all men who”.\\n\\n        (2) The Verb is “are.”\\n\\n        (3) The Predicate is “happy * * * .”\\n\\n        (4) Let Univ. be “men.”\\n\\n        (5) The Sign of Quantity is “all.”\\n\\n        (6) The Proposition now becomes “All | men who do not know what ‘toothache’ means | are | happy men.”]\\n\\n        (8) “Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.”\\n\\n        (1) The Subject is “farmers.”\\n\\n        (2) The Verb is “grumble,” for which we substitute the phrase “are * * * who grumble.”\\n\\n        (3) The Predicate is ” * * * who always grumble &c.\\n\\n        (4) Let Univ. be “persons.”\\n\\n        (5) The Sign of Quantity is “some.”\\n\\n        (6) The Proposition now becomes “Some | farmers | are | persons who always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.”\\n\\n        (9) “No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars.”\\n\\n        (1) The Subject is “lambs.”\\n\\n        (2) The Verb is “are.”\\n\\n        (3) The Predicate is ” * * * accustomed &c.”\\n\\n        (4) Let Univ. be “animals.”\\n\\n        (5) The Sign of Quantity is “no.”\\n\\n        (6) The Proposition now becomes “No | lambs | are | animals accustomed to smoke cigars.”\\n\\n        (10) “I ca’n’t understand examples that are not arranged in regular order, like those I am used to.”\\n\\n        (1) The Subject is “examples that,” &c.\\n\\n        (2) The Verb is “I ca’n’t understand,” which we must alter, so as to \\nhave “examples,” instead of “I,” as the nominative case. It may be \\nexpressed as “are not under- stood by me.”\\n\\n        (3) The Predicate is ” * * * not understood by me.”\\n\\n        (4) Let Univ. be “examples.”\\n\\n        (5) The Sign of Quantity is “all.”\\n\\n        (6) The Proposition now becomes “All | examples that are not arranged \\nin regular order like those I am used to | are | examples not understood\\n by me.”\\n\\n        Section 3. A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, is a Double Proposition.\\n\\n        A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, asserts (as we already\\n know) that “All Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate”. \\nThis evidently contains, as a part of what it tells us, the smaller \\nProposition “Some Mem- bers of the Subject are Members of the \\nPredicate”.\\n\\n        [Thus, the Proposition “All bankers are rich men” evidently contains the smaller Proposition “Some bankers are rich men”.]\\n\\n        The question now arises “What is the rest of the information which this Proposition gives us?”\\n\\n        In order to answer this question, let us begin with the smaller \\nProposition, “Some Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate,”\\n and suppose that this is all we have been told; and let us proceed to \\ninquire what else we need to be told, in order to know that “All Members\\n of the Subject are Members of the Predicate”.\\n\\n        [Thus, we may suppose that the Proposition “Some bankers are rich men” \\nis all the information we posses; and we may proceed to inquire what \\nother Proposition needs to be added to it, in order to make up the \\nentire Proposition “All bankers are rich men”.]\\n\\n        Let us also suppose that the ‘Univ.’ (i.e. the Genus, of which both the\\n Subject and the Predicate are Specieses) has been divided (by the \\nProcess of Dichotomy) into two smaller Classes, viz.\\n\\n        (1) the Predicate; (2) the Class whose Differentia is contradictory to that of the Predicate.\\n\\n        [Thus, we may suppose that the Genus “men,” (of which both “bankers” \\nand “rich men” are Specieses) has been divided into the two smaller \\nClasses, “rich men”, “poor men”.]\\n\\n        Now we know that every Member of the Subject is (as shown at p. 6) a \\nMember of the Univ. Hence every Mem- ber of the Subject is either in \\nClass (1) or else in Class (2).\\n\\n        [Thus, we know that every banker is a Member of the Genus “men”. Hence,\\n every banker is either in the Class “rich men”, or else in the Class \\n“poor men”.]\\n\\n        Also we have been told that, in the case we are discussing, some \\nMembers of the Subject are in Class (1). What else do we need to be \\ntold, in order to know that all of them are there? Evidently we need to \\nbe told that none of them are in Class (2); i.e. that none of them are \\nMembers of the Class whose Differentia is contradictory to that of the \\nPredicate.\\n\\n        [Thus, we may suppose we have been told that some bankers are in the \\nClass “rich men”. What else do we need to be told, in order to know that\\n all of them are there? Evidently we need to be told that none of them \\nare in the Class “poor men”.]\\n\\n        Hence a Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, is a Double \\nProposition, and is ‘equivalent’ to (i.e. gives the same information as)\\n the two Propositions\\n\\n        (1) “Some Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate”; (2) “No\\n Members of the Subject are Members of the Class whose Differentia is \\ncontradictory to that of the Predicate”.\\n\\n        [Thus, the Proposition “All bankers are rich men” is Double \\nProposition, and is equivalent to the two Propositions (1) “Some bankers\\n are rich men”; (2) “No bankers are poor men”.]\\n\\n        Section 4. What is implied, in a Proposition of Relation, as to the Reality of its Terms?\\n\\n        Note that the rules, here laid down, are arbitrary, and only apply to Part I of my “Symbolic Logic.”\\n\\n        A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “Some”, is henceforward to be\\n understood as asserting that there are some existing Things, which, \\nbeing Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. \\nthat some existing Things are Members of both Terms at once. Hence it is\\n to be understood as implying that each Term, taken by itself, is Real.\\n\\n        [Thus, the Proposition “Some rich men are invalids” is to be understood\\n as asserting that some existing Things are “rich invalids”. Hence it \\nimplies that each of the two Classes, “rich men” and “invalids”, taken \\nby itself, is Real.]\\n\\n        A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “No”, is henceforward to be \\nunderstood as asserting that there are no existing Things which, being \\nMembers of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that no \\nexisting Things are Members of both Terms at once. But this implies \\nnothing as to the Reality of either Term taken by itself.\\n\\n        [Thus, the Proposition “No mermaids are milliners” is to be understood \\nas asserting that no existing Things are “mer- maid-milliners”. But this\\n implies nothing as to the Reality, or the Unreality, of either of the \\ntwo Classes, “mermaids” and “milliners”, taken by itself. In this case \\nas it happerns, the Subject is Imaginary, and the Predicate Real.]\\n\\n        A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, contains (see Section \\n3) a similar Proposition beginning with “Some” Hence it is to be \\nunderstood as implying that each Term, taken by itself, is Real.\\n\\n        [Thus, the Proposition “All hyænas are savage animals” contains the \\nProposition “Some hyænas are savage animals”. Hence it implies that each\\n of the two Classes, “hyæna” and “savage animals”, taken by itself, is \\nReal.]\\n\\n        Section 5. Translation of a Proposition of Relation into or more Propositions of Existence.\\n\\n        We have seen that a Proposition of Relation, beginning with “Some,” \\nasserts that some existing Things, being Members of its Subject, are \\nalso Members of its Predicate. Hence, it asserts that some existing \\nThings are Members of both; i.e. it asserts that some existing Things \\nare Members of the Class of Things which have all the Attributes of the \\nSubject and the Predicate.\\n\\n        Hence, to translate it into a Proposition of Existence, we take \\n“existing Things” as the new Subject, and Things, which have all the \\nAttributes of the Subject and the Predicate, as the new Predicate.\\n\\n        Similarly for a Proposition of Relation beginning with “No”.\\n\\n        A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, is (as shown in \\nSection3) equivalent to two Proposition, one beginning with “Some” and \\nthe other with “No”, each of which we now know how to translate.\\n\\n        [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules.\\n\\n        (1) “Some apples are not ripe.” Here we arrange thus:– “Some” . . . . .\\n . . . . . .

A few simple considerations will, however, show that \\nsuch research must necessarily leave this question entirely unsettled, \\nand will indicate clearly that it is, from the very nature of things, a \\nquestion to which no definite and final answer can be given.\\n\\n        Among the barbarous tribes whose languages have been studied, even in a\\n most cursory manner, none have ever been discovered which did not show \\nsome familiarity with the number concept. The knowledge thus indicated \\nhas often proved to be most limited; not extending beyond the numbers 1 \\nand 2, or 1, 2, and 3. Examples of this poverty of number knowledge are \\nfound among the forest tribes of Brazil, the native races of Australia \\nand elsewhere, and they are considered in some detail in the next \\nchapter. At first thought it seems quite inconceivable that any human \\nbeing should be destitute of the power of counting beyond 2. But such is\\n the case; and in a few instances languages have been found to be \\nabsolutely destitute of pure numeral words. The Chiquitos of Bolivia had\\n no real numerals whatever, but expressed their idea for \"one\" by the \\nword etama, meaning alone. The Tacanas of the same country have no \\nnumerals except those borrowed from Spanish, or from Aymara or Peno, \\nlanguages with which they have long been in contact. A few other South \\nAmerican languages are almost equally destitute of numeral words. But \\neven here, rudimentary as the number sense undoubtedly is, it is not \\nwholly lacking; and some indirect expression, or some form of \\ncircumlocution, shows a conception of the difference between one and \\ntwo, or at least, between one and many.\\n\\n        These facts must of necessity deter the mathematician from seeking to \\npush his investigation too far back toward the very origin of number. \\nPhilosophers have endeavoured to establish certain propositions \\nconcerning this subject, but, as might have been expected, have failed \\nto reach any common ground of agreement. Whewell has maintained that \\n\"such propositions as that two and three make five are necessary truths,\\n containing in them an element of certainty beyond that which mere \\nexperience can give.\" Mill, on the other hand, argues that any such \\nstatement merely expresses a truth derived from early and constant \\nexperience; and in this view he is heartily supported by Tylor. But why \\nthis question should provoke controversy, it is difficult for the \\nmathematician to understand. Either view would seem to be correct, \\naccording to the standpoint from which the question is approached. We \\nknow of no language in which the suggestion of number does not appear, \\nand we must admit that the words which give expression to the number \\nsense would be among the early words to be formed in any language. They \\nexpress ideas which are, at first, wholly concrete, which are of the \\ngreatest possible simplicity, and which seem in many ways to be clearly \\nunderstood, even by the higher orders of the brute creation. The origin \\nof number would in itself, then, appear to lie beyond the proper limits \\nof inquiry; and the primitive conception of number to be fundamental \\nwith human thought.\\n\\n        In connection with the assertion that the idea of number seems to be \\nunderstood by the higher orders of animals, the following brief \\nquotation from a paper by Sir John Lubbock may not be out of place: \\n\"Leroy ... mentions a case in which a man was anxious to shoot a crow. \\n\\'To deceive this suspicious bird, the plan was hit upon of sending two \\nmen to the watch house, one of whom passed on, while the other remained;\\n but the crow counted and kept her distance. The next day three went, \\nand again she perceived that only two retired. In fine, it was found \\nnecessary to send five or six men to the watch house to put her out in \\nher calculation. The crow, thinking that this number of men had passed \\nby, lost no time in returning.\\' From this he inferred that crows could \\ncount up to four. Lichtenberg mentions a nightingale which was said to \\ncount up to three. Every day he gave it three mealworms, one at a time. \\nWhen it had finished one it returned for another, but after the third it\\n knew that the feast was over.... There is an amusing and suggestive \\nremark in Mr. Galton\\'s interesting Narrative of an Explorer in Tropical \\nSouth Africa. After describing the Demara\\'s weakness in calculations, he\\n says: \\'Once while I watched a Demara floundering hopelessly in a \\ncalculation on one side of me, I observed, \"Dinah,\" my spaniel, equally \\nembarrassed on the other; she was overlooking half a dozen of her \\nnew-born puppies, which had been removed two or three times from her, \\nand her anxiety was excessive, as she tried to find out if they were all\\n present, or if any were still missing. She kept puzzling and running \\nher eyes over them backwards and forwards, but could not satisfy \\nherself. She evidently had a vague notion of counting, but the figure \\nwas too large for her brain. Taking the two as they stood, dog and \\nDemara, the comparison reflected no great honour on the man....\\' \\nAccording to my bird-nesting recollections, which I have refreshed by \\nmore recent experience, if a nest contains four eggs, one may safely be \\ntaken; but if two are removed, the bird generally deserts. Here, then, \\nit would seem as if we had some reason for supposing that there is \\nsufficient intelligence to distinguish three from four. An interesting \\nconsideration arises with reference to the number of the victims \\nallotted to each cell by the solitary wasps. One species of Ammophila \\nconsiders one large caterpillar of Noctua segetum enough; one species of\\n Eumenes supplies its young with five victims; another 10, 15, and even \\nup to 24. The number appears to be constant in each species. How does \\nthe insect know when her task is fulfilled? Not by the cell being \\nfilled, for if some be removed, she does not replace them. When she has \\nbrought her complement she considers her task accomplished, whether the \\nvictims are still there or not. How, then, does she know when she has \\nmade up the number 24? Perhaps it will be said that each species feels \\nsome mysterious and innate tendency to provide a certain number of \\nvictims. This would, under no circumstances, be any explanation; but it \\nis not in accordance with the facts. In the genus Eumenes the males are \\nmuch smaller than the females.... If the egg is male, she supplies five;\\n if female, 10 victims. Does she count? Certainly this seems very like a\\n commencement of arithmetic.\"\\n\\n        Many writers do not agree with the conclusions which Lubbock reaches; \\nmaintaining that there is, in all such instances, a perception of \\ngreater or less quantity rather than any idea of number. But a careful \\nconsideration of the objections offered fails entirely to weaken the \\nargument. Example after example of a nature similar to those just quoted\\n might be given, indicating on the part of animals a perception of the \\ndifference between 1 and 2, or between 2 and 3 and 4; and any reasoning \\nwhich tends to show that it is quantity rather than number which the \\nanimal perceives, will apply with equal force to the Demara, the \\nChiquito, and the Australian. Hence the actual origin of number may \\nsafely be excluded from the limits of investigation, and, for the \\npresent, be left in the field of pure speculation.\\n\\n        A most inviting field for research is, however, furnished by the \\nprimitive methods of counting and of giving visible expression to the \\nidea of number. Our starting-point must, of course, be the sign \\nlanguage, which always precedes intelligible speech; and which is so \\nconvenient and so expressive a method of communication that the human \\nfamily, even in its most highly developed branches, never wholly lays it\\n aside. It may, indeed, be stated as a universal law, that some \\npractical method of numeration has, in the childhood of every nation or \\ntribe, preceded the formation of numeral words.\\n\\n        Practical methods of numeration are many in number and diverse in kind.\\n But the one primitive method of counting which seems to have been \\nalmost universal throughout all time is the finger method. It is a \\nmatter of common experience and observation that every child, when he \\nbegins to count, turns instinctively to his fingers; and, with these \\nconvenient aids as counters, tallies off the little number he has in \\nmind. This method is at once so natural and obvious that there can be no\\n doubt that it has always been employed by savage tribes, since the \\nfirst appearance of the human race in remote antiquity. All research \\namong uncivilized peoples has tended to confirm this view, were \\nconfirmation needed of anything so patent. Occasionally some exception \\nto this rule is found; or some variation, such as is presented by the \\nforest tribes of Brazil, who, instead of counting on the fingers \\nthemselves, count on the joints of their fingers. As the entire number \\nsystem of these tribes appears to be limited to three, this variation is\\n no cause for surprise.\\n\\n        The variety in practical methods of numeration observed among savage \\nraces, and among civilized peoples as well, is so great that any \\ndetailed account of them would be almost impossible. In one region we \\nfind sticks or splints used; in another, pebbles or shells; in another, \\nsimple scratches, or notches cut in a stick, Robinson Crusoe fashion; in\\n another, kernels or little heaps of grain; in another, knots on a \\nstring; and so on, in diversity of method almost endless. Such are the \\ndevices which have been, and still are, to be found in the daily habit \\nof great numbers of Indian, negro, Mongolian, and Malay tribes; while, \\nto pass at a single step to the other extremity of intellectual \\ndevelopment, the German student keeps his beer score by chalk marks on \\nthe table or on the wall. But back of all these devices, and forming a \\ncommon origin to which all may be referred, is the universal finger \\nmethod; the method with which all begin, and which all find too \\nconvenient ever to relinquish entirely, even though their civilization \\nbe of the highest type. Any such mode of counting, whether involving the\\n use of the fingers or not, is to be regarded simply as an extraneous \\naid in the expression or comprehension of an idea which the mind cannot \\ngrasp, or cannot retain, without assistance. The German student scores \\nhis reckoning with chalk marks because he might otherwise forget; while \\nthe Andaman Islander counts on his fingers because he has no other \\nmethod of counting,—or, in other words, of grasping the idea of number. A\\n single illustration may be given which typifies all practical methods \\nof numeration. More than a century ago travellers in Madagascar observed\\n a curious but simple mode of ascertaining the number of soldiers in an \\narmy. Each soldier was made to go through a passage in the presence of \\nthe principal chiefs; and as he went through, a pebble was dropped on \\nthe ground. This continued until a heap of 10 was obtained, when one was\\n set aside and a new heap begun. Upon the completion of 10 heaps, a \\npebble was set aside to indicate 100; and so on until the entire army \\nhad been numbered. Another illustration, taken from the very antipodes \\nof Madagascar, recently found its way into print in an incidental \\nmanner, and is so good that it deserves a place beside de Flacourt\\'s \\ntime-honoured example. Mom Cely, a Southern negro of unknown age, finds \\nherself in debt to the storekeeper; and, unwilling to believe that the \\namount is as great as he represents, she proceeds to investigate the \\nmatter in her own peculiar way. She had \"kept a tally of these purchases\\n by means of a string, in which she tied commemorative knots.\" When her \\ncreditor \"undertook to make the matter clear to Cely\\'s comprehension, he\\n had to proceed upon a system of her own devising. A small notch was cut\\n in a smooth white stick for every dime she owed, and a large notch when\\n the dimes amounted to a dollar; for every five dollars a string was \\ntied in the fifth big notch, Cely keeping tally by the knots in her bit \\nof twine; thus, when two strings were tied about the stick, the ten \\ndollars were seen to be an indisputable fact.\" This interesting method \\nof computing the amount of her debt, whether an invention of her own or a\\n survival of the African life of her parents, served the old negro \\nwoman\\'s purpose perfectly; and it illustrates, as well as a score of \\nexamples could, the methods of numeration to which the children of \\nbarbarism resort when any number is to be expressed which exceeds the \\nnumber of counters with which nature has provided them. The fingers are,\\n however, often employed in counting numbers far above the first decade.\\n After giving the Il-Oigob numerals up to 60, Müller adds: \"Above 60 all\\n numbers, indicated by the proper figure pantomime, are expressed by \\nmeans of the word ipi.\" We know, moreover, that many of the American \\nIndian tribes count one ten after another on their fingers; so that, \\nwhatever number they are endeavouring to indicate, we need feel no \\nsurprise if the savage continues to use his fingers throughout the \\nentire extent of his counts. In rare instances we find tribes which, \\nlike the Mairassis of the interior of New Guinea, appear to use nothing \\nbut finger pantomime. This tribe, though by no means destitute of the \\nnumber sense, is said to have no numerals whatever, but to use the \\nsingle word awari with each show of fingers, no matter how few or how \\nmany are displayed.\\n\\n        In the methods of finger counting employed by savages a considerable \\ndegree of uniformity has been observed. Not only does he use his fingers\\n to assist him in his tally, but he almost always begins with the little\\n finger of his left hand, thence proceeding towards the thumb, which is \\n5. From this point onward the method varies. Sometimes the second 5 also\\n is told off on the left hand, the same order being observed as in the \\nfirst 5; but oftener the fingers of the right hand are used, with a \\nreversal of the order previously employed; i.e. the thumb denotes 6, the\\n index finger 7, and so on to the little finger, which completes the \\ncount to 10.\\n\\n        At first thought there would seem to be no good reason for any marked \\nuniformity of method in finger counting. Observation among children \\nfails to detect any such thing; the child beginning, with almost entire \\nindifference, on the thumb or on the little finger of the left hand. My \\nown observation leads to the conclusion that very young children have a \\nslight, though not decided preference for beginning with the thumb. \\nExperiments in five different primary rooms in the public schools of \\nWorcester, Mass., showed that out of a total of 206 children, 57 began \\nwith the little finger and 149 with the thumb. But the fact that nearly \\nthree-fourths of the children began with the thumb, and but one-fourth \\nwith the little finger, is really far less significant than would appear\\n at first thought. Children of this age, four to eight years, will count\\n in either way, and sometimes seem at a loss themselves to know where to\\n begin. In one school room where this experiment was tried the teacher \\nincautiously asked one child to count on his fingers, while all the \\nother children in the room watched eagerly to see what he would do. He \\nbegan with the little finger—and so did every child in the room after \\nhim. In another case the same error was made by the teacher, and the \\nchild first asked began with the thumb. Every other child in the room \\ndid the same, each following, consciously or unconsciously, the example \\nof the leader. The results from these two schools were of course \\nrejected from the totals which are given above; but they serve an \\nexcellent purpose in showing how slight is the preference which very \\nyoung children have in this particular. So slight is it that no definite\\n law can be postulated of this age; but the tendency seems to be to hold\\n the palm of the hand downward, and then begin with the thumb. The \\nwriter once saw a boy about seven years old trying to multiply 3 by 6; \\nand his method of procedure was as follows: holding his left hand with \\nits palm down, he touched with the forefinger of his right hand the \\nthumb, forefinger, and middle finger successively of his left hand. Then\\n returning to his starting-point, he told off a second three in the same\\n manner. This process he continued until he had obtained 6 threes, and \\nthen he announced his result correctly. If he had been a few years \\nolder, he might not have turned so readily to his thumb as a \\nstarting-point for any digital count. The indifference manifested by \\nvery young children gradually disappears, and at the age of twelve or \\nthirteen the tendency is decidedly in the direction of beginning with \\nthe little finger. Fully three-fourths of all persons above that age \\nwill be found to count from the little finger toward the thumb, thus \\nreversing the proportion that was found to obtain in the primary school \\nrooms examined.\\n\\n        With respect to finger counting among civilized peoples, we fail, then,\\n to find any universal law; the most that can be said is that more begin\\n with the little finger than with the thumb. But when we proceed to the \\nstudy of this slight but important particular among savages, we find \\nthem employing a certain order of succession with such substantial \\nuniformity that the conclusion is inevitable that there must lie back of\\n this some well-defined reason, or perhaps instinct, which guides them \\nin their choice. This instinct is undoubtedly the outgrowth of the \\nalmost universal right-handedness of the human race. In finger counting,\\n whether among children or adults, the beginning is made on the left \\nhand, except in the case of left-handed individuals; and even then the \\nstart is almost as likely to be on the left hand as on the right. Savage\\n tribes, as might be expected, begin with the left hand. Not only is \\nthis custom almost invariable, when tribes as a whole are considered, \\nbut the little finger is nearly always called into requisition first. To\\n account for this uniformity, Lieutenant Gushing gives the following \\ntheory, which is well considered, and is based on the results of careful\\n study and observation among the Zuñi Indians of the Southwest: \\n\"Primitive man when abroad never lightly quit hold of his weapons. If he\\n wanted to count, he did as the Zuñi afield does to-day; he tucked his \\ninstrument under his left arm, thus constraining the latter, but leaving\\n the right hand free, that he might check off with it the fingers of the\\n rigidly elevated left hand. From the nature of this position, however, \\nthe palm of the left hand was presented to the face of the counter, so \\nthat he had to begin his score on the little finger of it, and continue \\nhis counting from the right leftward. An inheritance of this may be \\ndetected to-day in the confirmed habit the Zuñi has of gesticulating \\nfrom the right leftward, with the fingers of the right hand over those \\nof the left, whether he be counting and summing up, or relating in any \\norderly manner.\" Here, then, is the reason for this otherwise \\nunaccountable phenomenon. If savage man is universally right-handed, he \\nwill almost inevitably use the index finger of his right hand to mark \\nthe fingers counted, and he will begin his count just where it is most \\nconvenient. In his case it is with the little finger of the left hand. \\nIn the case of the child trying to multiply 3 by 6, it was with the \\nthumb of the same hand. He had nothing to tuck under his arm; so, in \\nraising his left hand to a position where both eye and counting finger \\ncould readily run over its fingers, he held the palm turned away from \\nhis face. The same choice of starting-point then followed as with the \\nsavage—the finger nearest his right hand; only in this case the finger \\nwas a thumb. The deaf mute is sometimes taught in this manner, which is \\nfor him an entirely natural manner. A left-handed child might be \\nexpected to count in a left-to-right manner, beginning, probably, with \\nthe thumb of his right hand.\\n\\n        To the law just given, that savages begin to count on the little finger\\n of the left hand, there have been a few exceptions noted; and it has \\nbeen observed that the method of progression on the second hand is by no\\n means as invariable as on the first. The Otomacs of South America began\\n their count with the thumb, and to express the number 3 would use the \\nthumb, forefinger, and middle finger. The Maipures, oddly enough, seem \\nto have begun, in some cases at least, with the forefinger; for they are\\n reported as expressing 3 by means of the fore, middle, and ring \\nfingers. The Andamans begin with the little finger of either hand, \\ntapping the nose with each finger in succession. If they have but one to\\n express, they use the forefinger of either hand, pronouncing at the \\nsame time the proper word. The Bahnars, one of the native tribes of the \\ninterior of Cochin China, exhibit no particular order in the sequence of\\n fingers used, though they employ their digits freely to assist them in \\ncounting. Among certain of the negro tribes of South Africa the little \\nfinger of the right hand is used for 1, and their count proceeds from \\nright to left. With them, 6 is the thumb of the left hand, 7 the \\nforefinger, and so on. They hold the palm downward instead of upward, \\nand thus form a complete and striking exception to the law which has \\nbeen found to obtain with such substantial uniformity in other parts of \\nthe uncivilized world. In Melanesia a few examples of preference for \\nbeginning with the thumb may also be noticed. In the Banks Islands the \\nnatives begin by turning down the thumb of the right hand, and then the \\nfingers in succession to the little finger, which is 5. This is followed\\n by the fingers of the left hand, both hands with closed fists being \\nheld up to show the completed 10. In Lepers\\' Island, they begin with the\\n thumb, but, having reached 5 with the little finger, they do not pass \\nto the other hand, but throw up the fingers they have turned down, \\nbeginning with the forefinger and keeping the thumb for 10. In the use \\nof the single hand this people is quite peculiar. The second 5 is almost\\n invariably told off by savage tribes on the second hand, though in \\npassing from the one to the other primitive man does not follow any \\ninvariable law. He marks 6 with either the thumb or the little finger. \\nProbably the former is the more common practice, but the statement \\ncannot be made with any degree of certainty. Among the Zulus the \\nsequence is from thumb to thumb, as is the case among the other South \\nAfrican tribes just mentioned; while the Veis and numerous other African\\n tribes pass from thumb to little finger. The Eskimo, and nearly all the\\n American Indian tribes, use the correspondence between 6 and the thumb;\\n but this habit is by no means universal. Respecting progression from \\nright to left or left to right on the toes, there is no general law with\\n which the author is familiar. Many tribes never use the toes in \\ncounting, but signify the close of the first 10 by clapping the hands \\ntogether, by a wave of the right hand, or by designating some object; \\nafter which the fingers are again used as before.\\n\\n        One other detail in finger counting is worthy of a moment\\'s notice. It \\nseems to have been the opinion of earlier investigators that in his \\npassage from one finger to the next, the savage would invariably bend \\ndown, or close, the last finger used; that is, that the count began with\\n the fingers open and outspread. This opinion is, however, erroneous. \\nSeveral of the Indian tribes of the West begin with the hand clenched, \\nand open the fingers one by one as they proceed. This method is much \\nless common than the other, but that it exists is beyond question.\\n\\n        In the Muralug Island, in the western part of Torres Strait, a somewhat\\n remarkable method of counting formerly existed, which grew out of, and \\nis to be regarded as an extension of, the digital method. Beginning with\\n the little finger of the left hand, the natives counted up to 5 in the \\nusual manner, and then, instead of passing to the other hand, or \\nrepeating the count on the same fingers, they expressed the numbers from\\n 6 to 10 by touching and naming successively the left wrist, left elbow,\\n left shoulder, left breast, and sternum. Then the numbers from 11 to 19\\n were indicated by the use, in inverse order, of the corresponding \\nportions of the right side, arm, and hand, the little finger of the \\nright hand signifying 19. The words used were in each case the actual \\nnames of the parts touched; the same word, for example, standing for 6 \\nand 14; but they were never used in the numerical sense unless \\naccompanied by the proper gesture, and bear no resemblance to the common\\n numerals, which are but few in number. This method of counting is \\nrapidly dying out among the natives of the island, and is at the present\\n time used only by old people. Variations on this most unusual custom \\nhave been found to exist in others of the neighbouring islands, but none\\n were exactly similar to it. One is also reminded by it of a custom \\nwhich has for centuries prevailed among bargainers in the East, of \\nsignifying numbers by touching the joints of each other\\'s fingers under a\\n cloth. Every joint has a special signification; and the entire system \\nis undoubtedly a development from finger counting. The buyer or seller \\nwill by this method express 6 or 60 by stretching out the thumb and \\nlittle finger and closing the rest of the fingers. The addition of the \\nfourth finger to the two thus used signifies 7 or 70; and so on. \"It is \\nsaid that between two brokers settling a price by thus snipping with the\\n fingers, cleverness in bargaining, offering a little more, hesitating, \\nexpressing an obstinate refusal to go further, etc., are as clearly \\nindicated as though the bargaining were being carried on in words.\\n\\n        The place occupied, in the intellectual development of man, by finger \\ncounting and by the many other artificial methods of reckoning,—pebbles,\\n shells, knots, the abacus, etc.,—seems to be this: The abstract \\nprocesses of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and even \\ncounting itself, present to the mind a certain degree of difficulty. To \\nassist in overcoming that difficulty, these artificial aids are called \\nin; and, among savages of a low degree of development, like the \\nAustralians, they make counting possible. A little higher in the \\nintellectual scale, among the American Indians, for example, they are \\nemployed merely as an artificial aid to what could be done by mental \\neffort alone. Finally, among semi-civilized and civilized peoples, the \\nsame processes are retained, and form a part of the daily life of almost\\n every person who has to do with counting, reckoning, or keeping tally \\nin any manner whatever. They are no longer necessary, but they are so \\nconvenient and so useful that civilization can never dispense with them.\\n The use of the abacus, in the form of the ordinary numeral frame, has \\nincreased greatly within the past few years; and the time may come when \\nthe abacus in its proper form will again find in civilized countries a \\nuse as common as that of five centuries ago.\\n\\n        In the elaborate calculating machines of the present, such as are used \\nby life insurance actuaries and others having difficult computations to \\nmake, we have the extreme of development in the direction of artificial \\naid to reckoning. But instead of appearing merely as an extraneous aid \\nto a defective intelligence, it now presents itself as a machine so \\ncomplex that a high degree of intellectual power is required for the \\nmere grasp of its construction and method of working.\\n      \\n    \\n      \\n    '\n","  nan]]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"F_C88IX23bPW"},"source":["# Function to extract features from the text.\n","def text_analysis(input_text):\n","  # First, get a list of paragraphs by splitting on double enters\n","  paragraphs = input_text.split('\\n\\n')\n","\n","  # Next, get a list of sentences by splitting each paragraph on ., ?, !, or new\n","  # lines.
